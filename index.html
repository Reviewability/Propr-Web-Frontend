									<h2>How does it work?</h2>
									<p>Can this be used as a platform to anonymously provide feedback on how the contributors could improve their pull requests? Yes, but there is so much more to it!</p>
								</header>
								
								<p class="content">When one of the project maintainers close a pull request in a project that uses propr, our bot comments on the pull request with a feedback link. The short feedback survey has two open ended questions and three rating bars, all of which are optional. Filling the form is pretty much the last thing project managers and integrators have to do. <br>
								The reports dashboard collates feedback from integrators and project managers over multiple pull requests and a range of projects. Contributors to projects that use propr can readily see how their pull requests are doing, and how they can improve them. This is our way of ensuring that every feedback reaches the contributors!

							<h2>About us</h2>
							<p>We are a group of researchers from the Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) at the Delft University of Technology. We set out to find out what factors contribute to the “reviewability” of pull requests submitted to open source projects and in the process ended up creating <b>propr</b>.</p>
